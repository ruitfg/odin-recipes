    </ul>

    <h2>Directions</h2>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Step 1:</strong> In a Dutch oven, cook sausage, ground beef, onion, and garlic over medium heat
            until well browned.
            Stir in
            crushed tomatoes, tomato paste, tomato sauce, and water. Season with sugar, basil, fennel seeds, Italian
            seasoning, 1 teaspoon salt, pepper, and 2 tablespoons parsley. Simmer, covered, for about 1 1/2 hours,
            stirring
            occasionally.</li>
        <br>
        <li><strong>Step 2:</strong> Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook lasagna noodles in
            boiling water for 8 to
            10 minutes.
            Drain noodles, and rinse with cold water. In a mixing bowl, combine ricotta cheese with egg, remaining
            parsley,
            and 1/2 teaspoon salt.</li>
        <br>
        <li><strong>Step 3:</strong> Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).</li>
        <br>
        <li><strong>Step 4:</strong> To assemble, spread 1 1/2 cups of meat sauce in the bottom of a 9x13-inch baking
            dish. Arrange 6
            noodles
            lengthwise over meat sauce. Spread with one half of the ricotta cheese mixture. Top with a third of
            mozzarella
            cheese slices. Spoon 1 1/2 cups meat sauce over mozzarella, and sprinkle with 1/4 cup Parmesan cheese.
            Repeat
            layers, and top with remaining mozzarella and Parmesan cheese. Cover with foil: to prevent sticking, either
            spray foil with cooking spray, or make sure the foil does not touch the cheese.</li>
        <br>
        <li><strong>Step 5:</strong> Bake in preheated oven for 25 minutes. Remove foil, and bake an additional 25
            minutes. Cool for 15
            minutes before
            serving.</li>
    </ol>
